        <U>My Introduction</U>
        <br>

        <p>Greetings to people who made time to check my portfolio out. For those who came here to check my portfolio specifically, you must already know my name, and those who came here by mistake or opened a random portfolio, let me start my introduction by stating my name: Vijay Kabbur.</p>
        <p>I am just another human being on this planet called Earth. When viewed from such a bigger picture, I'm no one significant. But when you scale things down significantly, I'm an individual from Karnataka, India who has quite a few loved ones I care about, and I'm a loved one for them too, hopefully...* sigh *</p>
        <p>As for my career, I just completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and luckily got a job in Starmark Softwares where I'm receiving training currently.</p>

        <h4>Those serious and boring things aside, let's look at my interests.</h4>

                Puzzles.
                <details>
                    <summary>If you're really interested, click here to read more about why I love puzzles...</summary>
                    I absolutely love puzzles. Although the satisfaction I get after successfully solving a puzzle is really amazing, the main excitement for me would be the moment itself when I'm completely immersed in the puzzle and trying to come up with a solution. <br>I even got into programming because writing logic for programs is a lot similar to coming up with a solution for a puzzle!</details>

                Rhythm Games.
                <details>
                    <summary>Wanna know what Rhythm Games are? Click here and read for yourself!</summary>
                    As the name suggests, "Rhythm Games" is a genre of games, where the main goal is to interact along the rhythm of the level. All rhythm games have songs, and the interactions in the game must be done with the beat of the songs. There are usually 4 difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Expert. As the difficulty increases, the number of notes per second increases.<br>The player must have extraordinary reflexes to perfectly clear Expert level rhythm games.

                Japan.
                <details>
                    <summary>It's a country. You must know atleast that. Click to read more!</summary>
                    Japan is an East-Asian country, that I'm absolutely in love with. Be it the culture of Japan, the citizens of Japan who hold pride in their country, or the strength of the country to overcome any and every crisis they face, Japan is a country that deserves great respect.<br>My dream is to settle down in Japan and spend the rest of my life there visiting noteworthy places and watching anime!

                Philosophy
                <details>
                    <summary>This is someting I recently got into.</summary>
                    I don't like wasting time, so whenever I'm idle, even if there's no physical work to do, I start using my brain to think about something. Lately, I've been thinking about philosophical ideas. I select a random topic, like "Life" and start thinking about my own views about the topic. Its really fun. Sometimes, I even share my views with others and everyone has liked all of my views so far.<br>Philosophy for me, has now, become something that gives my life's existence a meaning.

                Light Novels.
                <details>
                    <summary>Novels specifically from Japan.</summary>
                    Light Novel is a term used to refer to novels specifically written by Japanese writers. Light Novels are divided into multiple volumes, each volume printed as a separate book. The first Light Novel I read was "Yahari Ore no Seishun Rabu Kome wa machigatteiru." which translates to English as "My Youth Romantic Comedy is Wrong, as I Expected". It does have romance and comedy as its elements, but they're second to the "Slice of Life". It has a total of 14 volumes, which amount to approximately 4000 pages. One of the best points of Oregairu (it's short name) is that it never gets boring, especially if philosophy is an interest for the reader.
